        </div>
        <p>This game explores the connection between mental health and the environment. The more the player nurtures nature, the brighter and more calming the world becomes. The game mechanics reflect the message: you must take care of the world around you to move forward and feel at peace.</p>

          ðŸ§  <span>MY WHY</span>
        </div>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by how nature flourishes when given the care it deserves. When I was younger, my grandmother would gently water the garden filled with fluttering butterflies and winding green vines. She'd hand me the watering can, encouraging me to help. Those quiet momentsâ€”caring for something togetherâ€”taught me to appreciate how life flourishes when nurtured with love. The garden wasnâ€™t just beautifulâ€”it was alive with purpose, and it planted the first seeds of inspiration in me. Watching plants grow, seasons change, and life return to places once forgotten fills me with awe and hope. Nature has a quiet strengthâ€”it heals, inspires, and connects us to something bigger. Through this game, I want to remind people of the beauty in growth, both in the natural world and within ourselves. We all have the power to nurture and make things bloom, starting with the smallest actions.</p>
